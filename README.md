Welcome!
I`d be glad to know how you found me and what for?

You can contact me via 8ajarz_zaprasza@protonmail.com
Just keep in mind that I check that mailbox once a month.

For now, I study Python, use Linux, somewhat interested in cybersecurity.

I do support Ukrainians in their fight for freedom, and if you have some project, which can help them - we can collaborate.
